I've been wanting to experiment with the motivational/productivity technique called 'Don't break the chain' (see
'[Don't break the chain](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret "Don't break the chain!")'
for more information). In short it comes down to this:

- Pick your goal.
- Mark off the days on which you work toward that goal.
- Use your chain of marked off days as a motivator.

So, what is my goal? Write a web application that can be use to manage a collection of
[Magic: The Gathering](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Summoner/ "Magic: The Gathering") (MTG) cards. This is something
I've been wanting to do for some time now (and actually started on several occasions). Why MTG cards? Because I
collect them ;-)

How will I keep track of the chain? I've decided to write a blog post every day about my latest experience in the
effort of working toward my goal. I figured this would act as an even better motivator then the regular calendar the
technique prescribes and would also fulfill some other goals of mine, like starting a blog (done ;)) and becoming a
better writer.

This blog post marks day one of...no idea, until it's done I guess. Wish me luck!

*Day #1*
