title: Checklist on Gatherer not displaying correct number
tags: mychain

While testing different checklists generated by the search API of Gatherer I came across an error in the way Gatherer displays the checklists. When searching for the cards in a particular set, Gatherer will display some of the cards more than once.

In my first test (see post from yesterday) I asserted that the scraper returned 155 cards after scraping the *[Mirrodin Besieged](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=checklist&amp;set=|[%22Mirrodin+Besieged%22])* checklist page. I counted the number of rows present in the source of the page and assumed that was the correct number.

Because there are different types of sets (most notably core sets and expansion sets) I added some tests for scraping other checklist pages. When writing a test for a checklist page of a set I own, *[Urza's Saga](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=checklist&amp;action=advanced&amp;set=|[%22Urza%27s+Saga%22])*, I took the total number of cards displayed on the top of the checklist page. This was 335 (see the top of the page).

The test failed because there are actually 350 cards on the page - this number is correct (I checked on one of the cards).

I went to check the *Mirrodin Besieged* set again. It has 155 cards, but on the checklist page it says 150. Something's not right here completely right here.
