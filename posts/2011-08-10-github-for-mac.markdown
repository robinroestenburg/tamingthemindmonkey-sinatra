title: Github for Mac
---

While setting up a repository for the new project on GitHub
([https://github.com/robinroestenburg/mtg](https://github.com/robinroestenburg/mtg)) I came across
[GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com/ "GitHub for Mac"). Don't know how long it has been available, have not seen it
before though.

I decided to try it out and play around with it a bit. I think it's pretty good. Basically it provides an graphical
interface to the perform the different git commands needed for interacting with GitHub (committing/synchronizing,
branching and cloning). I've made some screenshots of the application with one of my repositories loaded (repository
for the *sample_app* project I set up while following the
[Rails 3 Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org "Rails 3 Tutorial") by Michael Hartl (very good!)):

All local and remote branches and easy switching between them.

Graphical git status. Including an easy way to select the files you want to add to your commit, committing selected
files and a graphical diff per file. Personally I think this is quite an improvement over the different commands it
would take to type to perform these actions.

History of changes on current branch (with easy switching between branches).
